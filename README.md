# ConvGP

This was my project as part of the requirements for my Honours degree in Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington. 

The key idea is to combine aspects from genetic programming and convolutional neural networks
to overcome various limitations of ConvNets, i.e.

- Need for manually crafted architectures
- Poor Interpretability (Although google brain appears to be doing some promising research in this area [here]("https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/"), however a large limitation is still interpretability of feature interaction). 
- Require large amounts of training data
